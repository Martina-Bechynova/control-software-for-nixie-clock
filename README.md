## Thesis Abstract

The aim of this thesis is to create control software for a custom-made embedded system using an STM32WB microcontroller unit that can be configured via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The thesis concerns itself with analyzing the criteria placed on the software and the development of said software. The thesis also places emphasis on compatibility with the complementary BLE Android application that was developed for the custom device, but it does not cover the development of the application itself. The software is made from the ground up, because no suitable existing project was found that could be used as its basis. The result of the thesis is functional control software that can be used on the custom-made devices or as a basis for a similar project.
